Specs:

Spec variation 1:
* Clock class will have a method that takes a time of day as input
* Method will return the number of degrees between the 'hours' hand and the 'minute' hand
* Each second in a minute will be equivalent to 6 degrees (360 degrees divided by 60 seconds)
* Each hour on the clock will have a set number of degrees (12 o'clock = 0 degrees, 3 o'clock = 90 degrees, 6 o'clock = 180 degrees, etc)

Spec variation 2:
* User will input a time in hh:mm format.
* Hours and minutes will each be converted to degrees (as though they were hour and minute hands on a clock face):
  * Input: 9:15
  * Output: 270 degrees & 90 degrees
* The difference between these two numbers will be calculated and displayed to user:
 * Input: 9:15
 * Output: 180 degree difference
